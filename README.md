# image-import

This is a small tool that collects my images
(from a rsynced folder or sd-card) and organizes
them in a nice way for dart table to import and
handle.

It's also a way to learn and understand real issues
and how to solve in functional languages like Haskell.
This is my first try to do anything in Haskell.

Much of the deisgn is based on Marl Seemann's blog post:
  https://blog.ploeh.dk/2019/09/09/picture-archivist-in-haskell/
code here: https://github.com/ploeh/picture-archivist

Some of the support classes he supplied are used untill I understand
better or can make my own better informed chooses to fit my
usecase.
